Developed by Yellowme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Make the app have an editText (Text Field) and a button that when clicked, should launch a new activity, and that
Activity must have a textView in which it will display the text that was put in the editText.

    CONDITIONS: Activity: MainActivity with {
                 EditText with id: 'editTextUser'
                 Button with   id: 'buttonUser'
                 }

                 Activity: DisplayMessageActivity with {
                 TextView with id: 'textViewUser2'
                 }

                 The EXTRA_MESSAGE of the intent to create the second activity, should have a key "MESSAGE"
