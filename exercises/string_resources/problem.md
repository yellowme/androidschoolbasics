Welcome to the third Android School Basics exercise
Developed by Yellowme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Make the app have an editText (Text Field) that will have a hint with a string resource named 'hint_text_info' value 
and a textView that will display the text of a string resource named 'yellow_world'.

    CONDITIONS: Activity: MainActivity with {
                    EditText with id: 'editTextUser'
                    TextView with id: 'textViewUser'
                 }

                String resources {
                    Name: yellow_world    value: 'Yellow World!'
                    Name: hint_text_info  value: whatever you want  ex. 'banana' 
                }
